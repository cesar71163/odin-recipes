  <h2>Portuguese Cod Fish</h2>
  <p>An excellent cod fish dish. You must soak the salted cod over night and change the water at least twice. This is an easy fish meal with my mom's original ingredients.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds salted cod fish </li>
    <li>5 large potatoes, peeled and sliced </li>
    <li>3 large onions, sliced </li>
    <li>¾ cup olive oil </li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley </li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons tomato sauce</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>Soak salted cod in cold water overnight or for a few hours. Drain water, repeat. Heat a large pot of water until boiling. Cook cod for 5 minutes; drain and cool, leaving cod in large pieces. Set aside.</p>
    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <li>Step 3</li>
    <p>In an 8x11 casserole dish, layer half the potato slices, all of the cod, and all of the onions. Top with remaining potato slices. In a small bowl, mix together olive oil, garlic, parsley, pepper flakes, paprika, and tomato sauce. Pour evenly
      over casserole.</p>
    <li>Step 4</li>
    <p>Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.</p>
  </ol>
